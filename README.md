<h1> MindSafe üß†</h1>
</div>
In many regions, mental health patients face significant barriers to accessing professional care, such as stigma, limited availability of mental health professionals, being judged, and a lack of anonymity. These obstacles can discourage patients from seeking the help they need, which may lead to untreated mental health conditions, a worsening of symptoms, and decreased quality of life. On the other hand, healthcare providers, particularly mental health professionals, may struggle to connect with patients who are reluctant to share their struggles due to fears of judgment or confidentiality concerns.

## Our Why
In an age where confidentiality is key, Mindsafe aims to create a platform where mental health patients can communicate with doctors anonymously, ensuring privacy and a high standard of security at every stage of the interaction, providing a safe and secure environment for individuals seeking mental health support by connecting them with qualified professionals.By eliminating barriers such as the fear of being judged, we aim to make mental health support more accessible and confidential for those in need.

## Our Prototype
### Features

- Booking session
- Authentication
- System monitoring
- Help request functionality
- Workers management
- Password recovery

### How it works

##### Authentication
The part where we will have all built-in methods defined in the main auth system class so that whenever the user chooses the patient, doctor, system admin, or institutional admin, we can call that built-in method to serve him/her.

The patient and institutional admin will only have login, signup, forgot password, and exit options. Doctors will only have login and exit options; for system admin, we will only have login and exit options.  

- *Login*: after asking him/her the email(primary key) and password and it matches with the ones in the database, we will switch to the function from another file in the working directory and return his credentials in a dictionary so that we can use it while he/she will be in the system.

- *Signup*: we will ask him/her the user name he/she will be using in booking and whatever, the email which will act as the primary key, three questions that will be used during the recovery process, gender(Male, Female, LGBT)so that we can use that to offer personalized services.

- *Forgot password*: we will acquire the user's email so that we can check if it's in a database or not; if it's in the database, we will prompt the user with the recovery questions, and if all matches, we will show the password and then give him/her option to change password or go back to the login menu.

- *Exit*: we will go to the home menu.
